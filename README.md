# Currency Converter
> A program that provides information about currencies and converts between them.

## Description

This repository consists of three classes: Currency, Currency Converter, and Currency Trader. The Currency class stores an amount and currency type, and allows for easy modification of the stored amount. The Currency Converter class stores information on exchange rates and allows for a Currency to be changed to a different type.
